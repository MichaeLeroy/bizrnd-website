  <h1 title="Who am I?">Goals and Attitudes</h1>
  <h1 title="Skills and  Proficiencies">Skills</h1>
  <h2>Team Work and Communications</h2>
  <p>
    I'm highly capable of solving problems independently, but
    recognizes the synergy of good team work and the importance of
    clearly communicating progress and solutions in any technological
    enterprise.
  </p>
  <h3>Teamwork</h3>
  <p>
    I work well on teams, large and small, assuming a leadership role
    as needed to move the project forward.
  </p>
  <h3>Teaching</h3>
  <p>
    I am able to explain difficult technical concepts to team members
    of all levels of experience, from the professional to the assembly
    line worker.
  </p>
  <h3>Leadership</h3>
  <p>
    I'm excellent at recognizing the strengths and abilities of team
    members and channeling their efforts in their most effective
    directions.  I lead by example and work to empower team members to
    do their best.
  </p>
  <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
  <p>
    I am a strong contributor during brain storming sessions,
    providing creative and practical ideas and encouraging other team
    members to offer their contributions in turn.
  </p>
  <h3>Communications</h3>
  <p>
    I communicate clearly in both oral and written presentations, both
    formal and impromptu.  These presentations are to the point and
    well targeted to the interests and abilities of the audience
  </p>
  <h2>Computer Systems Administration</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>Network Administration</h3>
  <p>
    I've built networks from wiring and switches to domain
    controllers.  I've integrated diverse clients and servers into my
    networks, setup high quality firewalls to protect the internal
    network and added printers and scanners to the network.
  </p>
  <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
  <p>
    I have strong experience with the gamut of operating systems work:
    installation, upgrades, configuration and day-to-day management.
    This experience extends to Microsoft server and client systems as
    well as Linux and OpenBSD.
  </p>
  <h3>Security and Data Integrity</h3>
  <p>
    I use a good grasp of security principles to configure secure
    systems and networks.  I've developed backup strategies to protect
    from data loss, whether from hardware failure or user mishap;
    established and file permissions for security and smooth operation.
  </p>
  <h3>Help Desk</h3>
  <p>
    I've provided training and technical support to users of diverse
    capabilities and experience levels.  This support has been for
    hardware issues and operating system and security concerns.  I've
    supported numerous applications: Microsoft Office products, email,
    and specialized engineering and scientific applications.  
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Clinical Database Manager, I've trained and provided ongoing
    support to clinical personnel, study monitors and managers to use
    a clinical database application for study data entry and
    monitoring.  Much of the clinical database support was provided to
    remote users at clinical study sites via phone and desktop
    sharing sessions.
  </p>
  <h3>Computer Hardware</h3>
  <p>
    I'm well versed in the basic principles of computer hardware.
    I've built, repaired and upgraded servers, desktops, notebooks,
    networking hardware and peripherals.  A strong proponent of
    intelligent preventive maintenance, I've typically been been able
    to fix systems before failure, avoiding data loss and denial of
    access to critical systems.
  </p>
  <h2>Measurement, Analysis and Reporting</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>Clinical Databases</h3>
  <p>
    My work as a Clinical Database Manager entailed installation and
    administration of a Sybase database server and of the Clindex
    clinical trial management software that ran on this server.  This
    work included designing database tables and forms to support data
    entry and monitoring by the clinical trial personnel, all in
    accordance with the clinical trial protocols.  I wrote standard
    operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that the work was done
    consistently and according to the applicable regulations.
    Particularly challenging was the need to meet the then recently
    implemented federal regulations for electronic clinical trial
    records, Title 21 CFR Part 11 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    The FDA examined my implementation of Uromedica's clinical trial
    database during a Biomedical Monitoring (BIMO) inspection and
    found it to be sound, fully compliant with the regulations.
  </p>
  <h3>Risk Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    General physics knowledge and an understanding of product design
    and requirements make me a strong contributor to failure mode and
    effects analysis (<a title="Failure Mode and Effects Analysis"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis">FMEA</a>)
    and fault tree analysis (<a title="Fault Tree Analysis"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis">FTA</a>)
    for products and processes.
  </p>
  <h3>Product Design Verification and Process Validation</h3>
  <p>
    I'm experienced in the planning, analysis and documentation of
    product design verification and manufacturing process validation
    according to ISO 9000 standards.  Such work involves careful
    planning of the work, development of standard operating procedures
    (SOPs) to be followed in the work's implementation.  Finally the
    results of the work had to be presented in reports that clearly
    presented the results and demonstrated that the work was done
    according to the SOPs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a manufacturing process has been validated, it is important
    to ensure continuing quality and process capability.  I'm able to
    advise on statistical process control testing and sampling plans
    to institute appropriate manufacturing process monitoring.
  </p>
  <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Data extraction, aggregation, munging, description and statistical
    analysis using SQL, Infomaker, Perl, Python and R
  </p>
  <h3>Reporting</h3>
  <p>
    I write clear, rigorous and readable reports using Microsoft
    Office, Open Office, HTML and LaTeX.
  </p>
  <h2>Technological Capabilities</h2>
  <p>
    My education in experimental physics and subsequent work
    experience have given me a broad background in measurement and
    fabrication technologies.  I've used these abilities to fabricate
    engineering prototypes and to test and troubleshoot products and
    processes.  
  </p>
  <h3>Data Acquisition and Automation</h3>
  <p>
    I have a good knowledge of automated test, measurement and control
    technologies.  I've setup multichannel systems using desktop
    computers and LabView and smaller embedded control systems using
    Scratch and Python.  I'm able to provide appropriate signal
    conditioning for a wide variety of physical sensors to provide
    meaningful and relevant data.  I've setup PID heating controls to
    provide tightly regulated temperature cycles for brazing and
    curing processes.  I've also setup systems of actuators and load
    cells to support tensile testing.
