  <h1 title="Who am I?">Goals and Attitudes</h1>
  <h1 title="Skills and  Proficiencies">Skills</h1>
  <h2>Team Work and Communications</h2>
  <p>
    I'm highly capable of solving problems independently, but
    recognizes the synergy of good team work and the importance of
    clearly communicating progress and solutions in any technological
    enterprise.
  </p>
  <h3>Teamwork</h3>
  <p>
    I work well on teams, large and small, assuming a leadership role
    as needed to move the project forward.
  </p>
  <h3>Teaching</h3>
  <p>
    I am able to explain difficult technical concepts to team members
    of all levels of experience, from the professional to the assembly
    line worker.
  </p>
  <h3>Leadership</h3>
  <p>
    I'm excellent at recognizing the strengths and abilities of team
    members and channeling their efforts in their most effective
    directions.  I lead by example and work to empower team members to
    do their best.
  </p>
  <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
  <p>
    I am a strong contributor during brain storming sessions,
    providing creative and practical ideas and encouraging other team
    members to offer their contributions in turn.
  </p>
  <h3>Communications</h3>
  <p>
    I communicate clearly in both oral and written presentations, both
    formal and impromptu.  These presentations are to the point and
    well targeted to the interests and abilities of the audience
  </p>
  <h2>Computer Systems Administration</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>Network Administration</h3>
  <p>
    I've built networks from wiring and switches to domain
    controllers.  I've integrated diverse clients and servers into my
    networks, setup high quality firewalls to protect the internal
    network and added printers and scanners to the network.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have well developed network troubleshooting skills, having
    encountered and solved many networking issues.  By adopting a
    divide and conquer approach, I'm able to rapidly isolate the
    source and cause of most problems, be it in hardware, software,
    configuration, or owing to off-site problems.  Once identified,
    the root causes of networking problems are often readily fixed.
    When problems result from off-site issues, I'm able to work
    smoothly with external vendor support staff to ensure that the
    issues are resolved in a timely manner, providing accurate
    information on the issue and the condition of the network.
  </p>
  <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
  <p>
    I have strong experience with the gamut of operating systems work:
    installation, upgrades, configuration and day-to-day management.
    This experience extends to Microsoft server and client systems as
    well as Linux and OpenBSD.
  </p>
  <h3>Security and Data Integrity</h3>
  <p>
    I use a good grasp of security principles to configure secure
    systems and networks.  I've developed backup strategies to protect
    from data loss, whether from hardware failure or user mishap;
    established and file permissions for security and smooth operation.
  </p>
  <h3>Help Desk</h3>
  <p>
    I've provided training and technical support to users of diverse
    capabilities and experience levels.  This support has been for
    hardware issues and operating system and security concerns.  I've
    supported numerous applications: Microsoft Office products, email,
    and specialized engineering and scientific applications.  
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Clinical Database Manager, I've trained and provided ongoing
    support to clinical personnel, study monitors and managers to use
    a clinical database application for study data entry and
    monitoring.  Much of the clinical database support was provided to
    remote users at clinical study sites via phone and desktop
    sharing sessions.
  </p>
  <h3>Computer Hardware</h3>
  <p>
    I'm well versed in the basic principles of computer hardware.
    I've built, repaired and upgraded servers, desktops, notebooks,
    networking hardware and peripherals.  A strong proponent of
    intelligent preventive maintenance, I've typically been been able
    to fix systems before failure, avoiding data loss and denial of
    access to critical systems.
  </p>
  <h2>Measurement, Analysis and Reporting</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>Clinical Databases</h3>
  <p>
    My work as a Clinical Database Manager entailed installation and
    administration of a Sybase database server and of the Clindex
    clinical trial management software that ran on this server.  This
    work included designing database tables and forms to support data
    entry and monitoring by the clinical trial personnel, all in
    accordance with the clinical trial protocols.  I wrote standard
    operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that the work was done
    consistently and according to the applicable regulations.
    Particularly challenging was the need to meet the then recently
    implemented federal regulations for electronic clinical trial
    records, Title 21 CFR Part 11 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    The FDA examined my implementation of Uromedica's clinical trial
    database during a Biomedical Monitoring (BIMO) inspection and
    found it to be sound, fully compliant with the regulations.
  </p>
  <h3>Risk Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    General physics knowledge and an understanding of product design
    and requirements make me a strong contributor to failure mode and
    effects analysis (<a title="Failure Mode and Effects Analysis"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis">FMEA</a>)
    and fault tree analysis (<a title="Fault Tree Analysis"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis">FTA</a>)
    for products and processes.
  </p>
  <h3>Product Design Verification and Process Validation</h3>
  <p>
    I'm experienced in the planning, analysis and documentation of
    product design verification and manufacturing process validation
    according to ISO 9000 standards.  Such work involves careful
    planning of the work, development of standard operating procedures
    (SOPs) to be followed in the work's implementation.  Finally the
    results of the work had to be presented in reports that clearly
    presented the results and demonstrated that the work was done
    according to the SOPs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a manufacturing process has been validated, it is important
    to ensure continuing quality and process capability.  I'm able to
    advise on statistical process control testing and sampling plans
    to institute appropriate manufacturing process monitoring.
  </p>
  <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Data extraction, aggregation, munging, description and statistical
    analysis using SQL, Infomaker, Perl, Python and R
  </p>
  <h3>Reporting</h3>
  <p>
    I write clear, rigorous and readable reports using Microsoft
    Office, Open Office, HTML and LaTeX.
  </p>
  <h2>Technological Capabilities</h2>
  <p>
    I possess good general physics and diverse technical knowledge, an
    ability to master new tools and technologies as needed to solve
    problems and meet goals.  Some highlights of my laboratory and
    technical proficiencies include.
  </p>
  <h3>Laboratory Techniques</h3>
  <p>
    I have extensive experience in the design, construction and use of
    scientific apparatus.  Often my work has entailed the integration
    of many off-the-shelf and custom components and systems into
    assemblies that perform sophisticated measurements.  This
    experience has given me a strong acquaintance with many laboratory
    techniques and practices including: high-vacuum, high-voltage,
    magnetic resonance, optics, and cryogenics.
  </p>
  <h3>Mechanical Design and Fabrication</h3> 
  <p>
    I'm familiar with machine shop techniques, material properties and
    mechanical design principles.  I've designed, built and used a
    wide variety of machine assemblies, from a mounting system capable
    of millimeter positioning accuracy of a one ton laboratory magnet
    to a tiny--sub-millimeter diameter--interventional neurology
    catheter prototype.
  </p>
  <h3>Electronics, Data Acquisition and Automation</h3>
  <p>
    I have good knowledge of electrical circuits and an excellent
    command of test and measurement equipment and have applied this
    knowledge to the use and development of scientific and engineering
    apparatus for both measurement and control of experiments.  My
    experience with measurements includes the entire chain of steps
    from the physical phenomena to reliable computer data:
    transduction, amplification and noise reduction, analog to digital
    conversion, and data acquisition and processing.  I've used
    trigger electronics and logic to coordinate the signals of many
    transducers to provide coherent measurements of complex phenomena.
    I've used computer control to manipulate electrical and mechanical
    parameters of apparatus during experiments, automating measurement
    processes.
  </p>
  <h3>Radiation Measurements</h3>
  <p>
    I'm an expert in spectroscopy and the measurement of ionizing and
    non-ionizing radiations.  I've worked with photons across the
    spectrum radio-frequencies, through infrared and optical, to
    x-rays and gamma radiation.  I've also made measurements of alpha
    and beta particles, neutrons and heavy ions.
  </p>
  <h3>Laboratory Safety</h3>
  <p>
    Workplace safety has always been a high priority for me.  I'm
    mindful of the physical, chemical and biological hazards posed by
    the equipment and processes that I work with and strive to keep
    hazards as low as reasonably possible.  As appropriate, I add
    safety interlocks, shielding and guards to the apparatus that I
    develop.  I respect the importance of, and strictly adhere to,
    safety measures and procedures as I accomplish my work.  I've
    safely worked with ionizing radiation, extreme cold and heat,
    high-voltage electrical systems, hazardous chemicals, and
    potential blood-borne pathogens.
