  <p>
    So far there's nothing fancy here.  I typically write the pages
    directly using emacs, which has a decent HTML mode.  I develop the
    pages on my primary machine, uploading the content to my hosting
    site when I'm satisfied that it's usable and useful.  I keep my
    local copy under version control with git.and serve them up with
    Apache.

    I browse the web with a wide range of devices: desktops,
    notebooks, tablets and cell phones.  When I started using the
    smaller devices, I was surprised at how poorly designed many
    websites were for rendering on the small screen.  I hope to do
    better than that with these pages.  I've not yet delved into
    responsive web design but may find myself doing so as this site
    moves beyond a mere repository of link pages.
