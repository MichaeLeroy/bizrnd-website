    This is a root of a site with several different collections of
    content and, as such, is merely a navigation tool serving as an
    entryway to these collections.

    for a long time the only purpose of this site.  I've found it
    handy to have my favorite links available online, especially as I
    use many different systems.  This content had been unchanged for a
    shockingly long time.  But the site did age gracefully, without
    too many links dying out or becoming irrelevant.  I've tossed out
    the old pages and am building a new set.  I find these pages
    useful, and if you do as well, that's great.

    is an extended on-line resume.  In a world of specialists, I'm a
    generalist.  This means that I have a very broad set of skills and
    know how to use them to solve a wide range of problems.  If you
    have any technological problems that are perplexing, difficult to
    describe and do not fit into the ambit of any of your specialists,
    I may well be the person you're looking for.

    Not much here yet.  For me it will be a set of references and
    tools for web development as well as a sandbox for learning and
    testing new techniques.
