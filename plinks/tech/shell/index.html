    I typically use Bash, so most of the content on this page is for
    that shell.

  <h2 title="Initialization Files, which ones to use for what">Which Initialization File?</h2>
  <p>
    Which of the several shell initialization files should one use to
    setup a customized environment?  It's a question that I have to
    ask when I do such work, so I'll answer it here for easy
    reference.  There are several reasons for the diversity of these
    configuration files.  One is that there are, in typical unix
    style, system-wide files that provide default configurations as
    well as per-user files for individualized customization.  Another
    reason is more subtle; Bash may be launched as either login or
    non-login and as either interactive or non-interactive.  Bash's
    configuration process depends upon its invocation according to
    these two properties.  There are some additional factors, such as
    startup in posix mode or when the effective user or group differs
    from the real user or group, which I'll not consider here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Non-login, non-interactive, bash sessions are spawned to process
    scripts.  Unless otherwise setup, these sessions inherit their
    environment from their parent environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Login sessions look first to <var>/etc/profile</var>, which serves
    as a site default.  Once this file is processed, the first
    available of the following user-specific files are processed for
    configuration: <var>~/.bash_profile</var>, <var>~/.bash_login</var>,
    and <var>~/.profile</var>.  (Though it seems that a login bash
    session should be interactive, it is possible to invoke a
    non-interactive shell as if it is a login session.  These
    non-interactive, login, sessions have the same configuration rules
    as a standard login session.)  Upon exit, a login shell will
    invoke <var>~/.bash_logout</var>, if it is available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Non-login, interactive, sessions turn sequentially to their site
    and user configuration files, <var>/etc/bash.bashrc</var>
    and <var>~/.bashrc</var>, respectively.  But what is a non-login,
    interactive, session?  Terminal programs
    (e.g. <var>konsole</var>, <var>xterm</var>, <var>quake</var>)
    within graphical environments provide non-login, interactive
    shells.  So most users, most of the time, will be experiencing
    bash in this way, which means that most bash customization aimed
    at creating a comfortable user environment should go
    into <var>~/.bashrc</var>.
