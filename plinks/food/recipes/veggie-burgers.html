  <h1 title="Homemade Veggie Burgers Described">What's Cooking</h1>
  <p>
    This is a recipe for black bean veggie burgers with chili style
    spicing.  It's certainly a treat for vegetarians, and meat eaters
    tired of the same old beef burger can enjoy them as well.
  </p>
  <h1 title="Sources of Inspiration for this Recipe">Sources</h1>
  <p>
    This is very much my own recipe.  I've developed it over probably
    a dozen batches, learning how to improve the results with each
    trial.  Getting a decent flavor was not too hard but achieving a
    decent consistency that held together well was a challenge.
  </p>
  <h1 title="Required Tools and Utensils">Tools and Utensils</h1>
  <p>
    No exotic tools are needed for this recipe.  A good pressure
    cooker helps when cooking the beans, and a food processor saves a
    lot of manual chopping.

    Just about any sort of bean works.  I've also had good luck with
    pinto and garbanzo beans, but I'd take a different approach to
    spicing with these alternatives.

  <p>
    One day prior to making the veggie burgers, rinse the beans and
    set them up to soak overnight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the beans have soaked, they're ready to be cooked.  Discard
    the soak water and rinse the beans.  If using a pressure cooker,
    add 6 cups of water to the beans and cook for 12 minutes at
    maximum pressure.  Allow the beans to cool naturally (rather than
    using a quick release method).  Once the beans have cooled drain
    the beans, reserving about ½ cup of the liquid for cooking the
    other ingredients.  Shake the beans a bit in colander so that the
    cooked beans are rather dry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cooking the beans without a pressure cooker will take somewhat
    more time.  Make sure that they're cooked until they're quit
    tender.
  </p>
  <h1 title="Preparing the Other Vegetables">Preparing the Vegetables</h1>
  <p>
    Finely chop the garlic and chili peppers.  I remove and discard
    the peppers' seeds and placenta to avoid painful fumes when I
    cook, but that step is up to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chop the root vegetables and set them aside.  As they're all going
    into the pan together, they can be added to a common bowl.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add the oil, garlic and chilies to the saucepan and saute under
    medium heat.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the garlic and chilies are tender, add a bit of the reserved
    bean cooking liquid.  Stir in the adobo seasoning and mix thoroughly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add the chopped root vegetables and walnuts, adding bean liquid
    and stirring to keep the ingredients from sticking to the pan.
    Ideally the root vegetables should be steamed tender by this
    process and not end up too wet.  This step may take some
    experience to develop a good feel for achieving the right
    consistency.  It's not terrible if these vegetables are a bit wet,
    but forming the veggie burgers may be messier.
  </p>
  <p>
    As this cooked vegetable mix is cooling, chop the beans in a food
    processor.  Once the vegetable mix has cooled enough to handle,
    combine it with the chopped beans in a large bowl.
  </p>
  <h1 title="Forming the Veggie Burgers">Forming the Veggie Burgers</h1>
  <p>
    Have the plastic storage bins at hand and cut several sheets of
    wax paper to comfortably fit these bins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a handful of the veggie burger mix and from it into a patty.
    You may want to adjust the cooking of future batches based on how
    the mix handles.  If the mix is too dry, it may be difficult to
    get the patty to hold together.  If it is too wet, the mix may
    stick too readily to your hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sprinkle some corn meal onto the top of the patty and lay it onto
    wax paper in a storage bin.  Then sprinkle some corm meal on the
    other side.  Once one has filled a layer of the container cover
    the patties with another sheet of wax paper.  It may be possible
    to stack 2 or 3 layers of veggie burgers in a container, depending
    upon its size and the uniformity of the patties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Freeze the veggie burgers.  They'll keep better frozen and be
    easier to handle when they are cooked.
  </p>
  <h1 title="Cooking the Veggie Burgers">Cooking the Veggie Burgers</h1>
  <p>
    Heat the oven to 350℉.  I like to cook the veggie burgers in a
    well cured cast iron skillet, which I preheat as well.  A cookie
    sheet also works, though the veggie burgers may be more liable to
    stick to the surface of the sheet.  I've not tried cooking on
    foil, but I suspect that that doing so would be awkward..
  </p>
  <p>
    Cook frozen veggie burgers for about 18 minutes on the first side.
    Then turn them and cook for another 15 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remove from the oven, serve on buns with your favorite condiments
    and enjoy.
