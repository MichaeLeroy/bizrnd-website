  <h1 title="Sourdough Cinnamon Rasin Bread Described">What's Cooking</h1>
  <p>
    I've begun to experiment with sourdough baking and have discovered that 
    it's possible to make a very nice, slightly sweet, cinnamon raisin bread
    starting with sourdough.  
  </p>
  <h1 title="Sources of Inspiration for this Recipe">Sources</h1>
  <p>
    I can't cite any particular sources for this recipe.  When I got
    my sourdough established and began to look for bread recipes, I
    found the information available less than completely helpful.
    Most of the recipes that I found called for conventional yeast as
    well as the sourdough.  I guess that the idea with these sorts
    hybrid recipes is that the convention yeast provides a quick easy
    rise, while the sourdough is somewhat relegated to a flavoring.  I
    did find a handful of purely sourdough recipes, but comparing
    these did not provide me with a clear and consistent picture of
    how to proceed.  So I just started cooking and accepted the risk
    that some of my results might become chicken feed rather than
    table fare.

  <h1 title="Required Tools and Utensils">Tools and Utensils</h1>
  <p>
    No exotic tools are needed for this recipe.  A stand mixer with a
    dough hook makes the kneading easy, but one can always knead by
    hand if a mixer is unavailable.

  <h1 title="Preparing the Sourdough for Cinnamon Rasin Bread">Sourdough Preparations</h1>
  <p>
    Grow a batch of sourdough from your starter a day prior to baking,
    feeding it about when you feed yourself.  Let the sourdough grow
    in a warm dark place between these feedings.  A 1 quart wide mouth
    mason jar is a handy container for process.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>at breakfast, in a 1 quart jar combine 1 tablespoon each of
    sourdough starter and whole wheat flour with a scant tablespoon of
    water</li>
    <li>at lunch, stir in ¼ cup whole wheat flour and a scant ¼ cup of
    water</li>
    <li>at supper, stir in ½ cup whole wheat flour and a scant ½ cup
    of water</li>
    <li>after growing overnight the culture should be ready for your
    bread in the morning</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 title="Mixing and Kneading the Dough for the Cinnamon Rasin Bread">Mixing and Kneading</h1>
  <p>
    Combine all but the last of the Bread Ingredients (the all purpose
    flour) in the stand mixer's bowl.  Turn the mixer on to a low
    speed and gradually spoon in the all purpose flour as the dough is
    kneaded.  It may be helpful at times, particularly early on, to
    pause the mixing and scrape the ingredients into the center of the
    bowl.  As sufficient flour is added, the dough will begin to pull
    away from the sides of the bowl and to drop off of the mixer's
    dough hook.
  </p>
  <h1 title="Rising the Dough and Forming the Loaf">Rising and Forming the Loaf</h1>
  <p>
    Once kneading is completed, the dough should be a firm, slightly
    tacky mass.  Flour your hands and gently form the dough into a
    ball.  Put the dough into a medium sized bowl containing enough
    vegetable oil to coat the dough and roll the dough around to coat
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cover the bowl with the clean towel and place it in a warm, dark
    and quiet place for rising.  Sourdoughs rise more slowly than
    breads made with commercial bread yeast, so it may take 3 to 4
    hours for the dough to double in size.  If you prepared the dough
    just after breakfast, it may have finished this first rise by
    about lunch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Punch down the dough and transfer it to an oiled loaf pan.  Cover
    the pan with the towel and let the dough rise a second time, so
    that it again doubles, probably by about supper time.
  </p>
  <h1 title="Baking the Cinnamon Rasin Bread">Baking the Bread</h1>
  <p>
    Bake the loaf in a 350℉ oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top
    crust browns slightly.  Some have suggested spritzing water into
    the oven every so often to provide a high humidity environment for
    the bread.  I've not tried this recipe enough times to discern
    whether this touch has any effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pop the bread out onto a cooling rack to let it cool a bit before
    enjoying your creation.
