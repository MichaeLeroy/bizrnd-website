  <h1>What's Cooking</h1>
  <p>
    Scones cover a lot of territory.  The recipe is for what might be
    considered British style scones, biscuit like, flavored, quick
    breads.  I usually go for sweet, but one can certainly adjust the
    flavoring and mix-ins for a savory effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    This recipe is derived from one that claims a yield of 8 scones,
    but I find my self using it for 4 large scones, each of which can
    be a meal in itself.

  <h1>Sources</h1>

    I looked through several scones recipes and tried a couple before

  <ul>
    <li>Mixing Bowl, say 2 quart</li>

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <h2>Dry</h2>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient">2 Cups Flour</h3>
  <p>
    I've tried a several flours.  So far, I've gotten the best results
    with King Arthur All Purpose.  This flour is said to be rather
    high in protien, so a good bread flour night work as well.  I'd
    advise against pastry flour; I found that adding it to the recipe
    results in cake-like scones.
