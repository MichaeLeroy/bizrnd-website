  <h1 title="Scones Described">What's Cooking</h1>
  <p>
    Scones cover a lot of territory.  The recipe is for what might be
    considered British style scones, biscuit like, flavored, quick
    breads.  I usually go for sweet, but one can certainly adjust the
    flavoring and mix-ins for a savory effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    This recipe is derived from one that claims a yield of 8 scones,
    but I find my self using it for 4 large scones, each of which can
    be a meal in itself.
  </p>
  <h1 title="Sources of Inspiration for this Recipe">Sources</h1>
  <p>
    I looked through several scones recipes and tried a couple before
    finding one that I liked, <a title="The Primary Parent of this
    Recipe"
    href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Simple-Scones/">allrecipes'
    Simple Scones</a>, which served as the main inspiration for this
    one.

  <h1 title="Required Tools and Utensils">Tools and Utensils</h1>
  <p>
    No exotic tools are needed for this recipe.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mixing Bowl (say 2 to 4 quart)</li>
    <li>Dry Measuring Cups and Spoons</li>
    <li>Pastry Blender (nice to have but I don't)</li>
    <li>Liquid Measuring Cup</li>
    <li>An Ordinary Fork</li>
    <li>Pastry Mat</li>
    <li>Baking Sheet</li>
    <li>Oven</li>
    <li>Cooling Racks</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 title="Recipe Ingredients">Ingredients</h1>
  <h2 title="Dry Ingredients">Dry</h2>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient" title="Two Cups of All-Purpose Flour">2 Cups Flour</h3>
  <p>
    I've tried a several flours.  So far, I've gotten the best results
    with King Arthur All Purpose.  This flour is said to be rather
    high in protein, so a good bread flour night work as well.  I'd
    advise against pastry flour; I found that adding it to the recipe
    results in cake-like scones.
  </p>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient" title="One Third Cup of Sugar">⅓ Cup Sugar</h3>
  <p>
    Or the dry sweetener of you choice.
  </p>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient" title="One and One Half Teaspoons of Baking Powder">1–½ Teaspoons Baking Powder</h3>
  <p>
    The source recipe calls for a mix of Baking Powder, Baking Soda
    and Salt.  I'm a skeptic of this traditional approach to quick
    breads.  So I omit the salt and soda, adding a bit more Baking
    Powder than called for in the original recipe.
  </p>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient" title="Dry Spice, Added to Taste">Powdered Spice</h3>
  <p>
    Here you can exercise some creativity, choosing a spice
    appropriate to the sort of scone you're making.  For sweet scones,
    I often use a touch
    of <a href="http://www.penzeys.com/cgi-bin/penzeys/p-penzeyschinese5.html">Penzeys
    Chinese Five Spice Powder</a>, which provides a nice depth of
    flavor.  If you're making a savory scone, consider adding pepper
    or a curry powder.  <span class="note">This flavoring should be in
    the background rather than the foreground, so add your spices with
    a light touch.</span>
  </p>
  <h2 title="Shortening Ingredients">Shortening</h2>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient" title="Six to Eight Tablespoons of
  Unsalted Butter">6 to 8 Tablespoons of Unsalted Butter</h3>
  <p>
    I like to use a good quality butter, which can add nicely to the
    flavor of the scones.  By tweaking the amount of butter, one can
    adjust the richness of the scones, from dry to dripping with
    butter.
  </p>
  <h2 title="Mix-In Ingredients">Mix-ins</h2>
  <p>
    The mix-in ingredients will define the flavor of your scones, and
    here is where you can be most creative.  Consider: fresh fruit,
    dried fruit, chopped nuts, chocolate chips, candies, sun dried
    tomatoes, or roasted garlic.  I often use a couple of
    mix-ins.  <span class="note">Don't overload the scone with the
    mix-ins; 1 to 1–½ Cups generally works well.  If in doubt, use
    less rather than more.</span>
  </p>
  <h2 title="Liquid Ingredients">Liquids</h2>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient" title="One Half Cup of Milk">½ Cup Milk</h3>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient" title="One Egg">1 Egg</h3>
  <h3 class="recipe-ingredient" title="Liquid Flavor, Added to Taste">Liquid Flavor</h3>
  <p>
    This is an optional ingredient.  Vanilla is conventional.
    Instead, I often add a liqueur, such as Drambuie or
    Cointreau.  <span class="note">As with the dry spice, use
    sparingly for background flavoring.</span>
  </p>
  <h1 title="Preparations for Cooking Scones">Preparations</h1>
  <p>
    The night before the cook
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>throw a stick of butter in the freezer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    At the outset of the cook:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>preheat the oven to 400℉.</li>
    <li>if necessary, prep the mix-ins</li>
    <li>have some space available for ingredient assembly</li>
    <li>have the pastry mat laid out</li>
    <li>lay out the cooling racks, keeping in mind that they'll shed
    crumbs, moisture and possibly shortening</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 title="Cooking Instructions">Cook</h1>
  <p>
    Thoroughly mix the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cut the cold shortening into the dry ingredients.  Blend until it
    is incorporated as small pebbles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stir in the mix-ins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prepare the liquid ingredients.  Measure out the milk, add the egg
    and beat moderately with a fork.  Add the liquid flavor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pour the Liquid ingredients into the mixing bowl and fold
    in.  <span class="note">Avoid over mixing; stop once the liquid is
    incorporated.</span>  The result should be a wet, sticky, dough.
  </p>
  <p>
    Generously dust the pastry mat and your hands with flour.  Dump
    the dough onto the pasty mat and form it into a flat loaf.  Cut
    this loaf into serving sized scones, flouring the edges to keep
    stickiness under control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Place the scones on the baking sheet and put them into the
    pre-heated oven.  Baking time may vary.  Start checking at about
    15 minutes.  Once the scones have a golden brown crust, they
    should be ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remove the scones from the oven and place them on the cooling
    rack.  Allow them to cool for several minutes and then enjoy.
