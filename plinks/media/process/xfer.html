  <h1>Media for Android</h1>
  <p>
    I have a large media collection, albums on a Logitech Media Server
    and lots of downloaded (and downloading) podcasts.  It's nice
    easily to move these media files to my Android phone for easy
    playback.  The audio quality of the phone isn't terrific, but
    that's not so important for non-musical material.  And when I want
    to listen to high quality, I use my old Headamp pico DAC/Amp and
    some Etymotic earphones.

  <h2>Youtube Lectures and Presentations</h2>
  <p>
    Some of my favorite listening are university lectures.  Often
    these lectures are posted on Youtube.  I suppose that I could
    audit the Youtube posts directly, but I prefer to download the
    videos, convert them to audio and upload them to my phone as
    albums.  This is pretty easy with 
    <a title="youtube-dl, Download videos from YouTube.com"
    href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a>.  
    I've had difficutly getting the playlist feature to work, but it
    is almost as easy to to feed this script a list
    of <code>videoID</code> tags.
