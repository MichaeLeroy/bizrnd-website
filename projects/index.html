  <h1 title="Project Listing">BizRND and Blackdog Projects</h1>
  <p>
    A project can be anything that is fun, interesting, educational,
    useful or profitable.
  </p>
  <h2 title="Projects in the Concept Phase">Project Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    These are project ideas.  Project goals and preliminary thoughts
    on implementation are available.  Details are apt to be sketchy,
    but more should come once a project moves to active development.
  </p>
  <h3><a title="A Remote Clicker Tag" 
	 href="clicker-tag/index.html">A Remote Clicker Tag</a></h3>
  <p>
    When clicker training, particularly when the dog is at a distance,
    it would be helpful to deliver that click near the dog rather than
    at your hand.
  </p>
  <h2 title="Projects Under Active Development">Projects in Development</h2>
  <p>
    These are projects that are currently under development.  As such,
    the pages for these projects are liable to change frequently as
    the projects progress.
  </p>
  <h3><a title="Raspberry Pi Server" 
	 href="pi-server/index.html">Raspberry Pi Server</a></h3>
  <p>
    Secure and configure a Raspberry Pi as a Web and Collaboration Server.
  </p>
  <h2 title="Completed or Largely Completed Projects">Completed Projects</h2>
  <p>
    These projects have been completed or have reached a mature stage
    of development.  These pages should be rather static and may serve
    as good guides for your own implementation.
  </p>
  <h2 title="Abandonded or Suspended Projects">Suspended Projects</h2>
  <p>
    These are projects that either have been abandoned or have been
    sidelined.  The state of development of these projects varies.
    Some of these projects may be reactivated or incorporated into
    other projects as conditions warrant.
